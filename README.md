Project Legion: Radial General Intelligence Architecture
1. Executive Summary
Project Legion is a recursive, multi-agent intelligence framework utilizing a 3D-spatial data topology. It employs a Differential Dual-Rail governance model and hardware-level cryptographic attestation to ensure logical coherence, executive alignment, and high energy efficiency across infinite fractal layers.
2. Core Topology & Spatial Addressing
 * Centric Authority (Origin): The system operates from a hardware-locked Core (r=0) serving as the primary executive and cryptographic Root of Trust (RoT).
 * Spherical Latent Space: Data and agents are addressed via spherical coordinates (r, \theta, \phi). Priority and authority are functions of radial proximity to the Core.
 * Fractal Scaling (Voltage Protocol): Recursive "Onion" layers are generated dynamically, governed by a 1/r^2 authorization decay. This mimics biological signal attenuation, ensuring that "distal" noise cannot override "proximal" executive intent.
3. Governance & Signal Integrity
 * Differential Dual-Rail Logic: Parallel processing paths (Left: Damped/Analytical; Right: Heuristic/Associative) provide a "Stereo" logic output.
 * Overwatch Layer (Differential Analysis): A real-time monitoring agent performing Phase-Correlation checks. By treating logic as a signal, it identifies "drifting" or "out-of-phase" outputs (hallucinations) before they reach the final summing stage.
 * Recursive Feedback Loop: Post-fader output is asynchronously routed back to the Core. This allows for real-time bias refinement and self-correction, closing the loop between executive intent and rendered output.
4. Hardware Security & Stability
 * Self-Nulling Protocol (ZSS): Hardware-level phase-inversion triggers a total system null (Common-Mode Rejection) if unauthorized core-swapping or physical tampering is detected. The system becomes mathematically transparent and silent rather than corrupted.
 * Unity Gain Relays: Intermediate nodes that re-validate and re-clock authorization tokens, maintaining bit-perfection and signal integrity across deep-shell fractals.
 * Dynamic Logic Compression: Variable-ratio limiting on sub-layer influence to prevent rogue-agent divergence without requiring process termination.
5. Operational Efficiency & Mobile Deployment
 * Geometric Sparsity: Unlike standard transformers with O(N^2) complexity, Legion utilizes 3D Spherical Attention. Agents only compute relationships within their immediate radial geodesic neighborhood, reducing memory bandwidth requirements by up to 90%.
 * Voltage-Gated Compute: The authorization protocol acts as a dynamic power-management layer. In thermal-constrained environments (Mobile/Edge), the Core restricts voltage to outer fractal shells, preserving battery by focusing compute on high-priority executive tasks.
 * NPU Dual-Rail Mapping: Optimized for asynchronous parallel processing on modern mobile SoCs, allowing physical pinning of Rails to independent NPU cores for true hardware-level "stereo" separation.
6. Mathematical Foundations (Training Objectives)
 * Phase-Correlation Loss: Training is governed by the loss function:
 L_{phase} = 1 - \left( \frac{L \cdot R}{\|L\| \|R\|} \right)
   
 * Angular Constraint: Any logic drift exceeding the defined Phase Window (e.g., 15^\circ) triggers an automatic gain reduction from the Overwatch, forcing the model to find a coherent "Phantom Center."
