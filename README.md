# Project Onion SE // The Voxel Manifold//Project Legion
> **Sovereign Swedish R&D into 3D Recursive Latent Space.**

## The Vision
Project **Onion SE** is the core technological layer of **Legion Systems SE**. We are moving beyond 1D token prediction into **3D Spatial Manifolds**. By mapping intelligence into a recursive voxel structure, we preserve the multi-dimensional relationships inherent in physical, biological, and acoustic systems.

# Project Legion: Radial General Intelligence Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary
Project Legion is a recursive, multi-agent intelligence framework utilizing a 3D-spatial data topology. It employs a dual-rail adversarial governance model to ensure logical coherence and executive alignment across infinite fractal layers.

## 2. Core Topology & Spatial Addressing
- **Centric Authority (Origin):** The system operates from a hardware-locked Core ($r=0$) serving as the primary executive and cryptographic root of trust.
- **Spherical Latent Space:** Data and agents are addressed via spherical coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$. Priority and authority are functions of radial proximity to the Core.
- **Fractal Scaling:** Recursive "Onion" layers are generated dynamically, governed by a $1/r^2$ authorization decay (Voltage Protocol).

## 3. Governance & Signal Integrity
- **Differential Dual-Rail Logic:** Parallel processing paths (Left: Damped/Analytical; Right: Heuristic/Associative) provide a "Stereo" logic output.
- **Overwatch Layer (Differential Analysis):** A real-time monitoring agent that performs phase-correlation checks on dual-rail outputs to detect and mitigate logic distortion (hallucination).
- **Unity Gain Relays:** Intermediate nodes that re-validate and re-clock authorization tokens to maintain signal integrity across deep-shell fractals.

## 4. Stability & Security
- **Self-Nulling Protocol (ZSS):** Hardware-level phase-inversion triggers a total system null (Common-Mode Rejection) if unauthorized core-swapping or tampering is detected.
- **Recursive Feedback Loop:** Post-fader output is asynchronously routed back to the Core for real-time bias refinement and executive alignment.
- **Dynamic Logic Compression:** Variable-ratio limiting on sub-layer influence to prevent rogue-agent divergence without process termination.

5. Operational Efficiency & Mobile Integration
 * Geometric Sparsity: Unlike standard 2D transformers with O(N^2) complexity, Legion utilizes 3D Spherical Attention. Agents only compute relationships within their immediate radial geodesic neighborhood, 
   reducing memory bandwidth and power consumption by up to 90%.
 * Voltage-Gated Inference: The "Voltage" protocol acts as a dynamic power-management layer. In low-battery states, the Core restricts voltage to outer fractal shells, 
   effectively "pruning" the model in real-time to maintain critical executive functions without thermal runaway.
 * NPU Dual-Rail Mapping: Optimized for modern mobile SoCs (e.g., Apple A-series, Snapdragon). The architecture allows for physical pinning of the Left Rail and Right Rail to independent NPU cores, ensuring phase-coherent asynchronous processing.
6. Sustainability Profile
 * Reduced Data Movement: By localizing compute within the 3D topology, the system minimizes the energy cost of moving data between memory and the processor—the primary bottleneck in mobile AI.
 * Edge-Native Governance: High-level reasoning is handled locally via the dual-rail adversarial check, eliminating the energy and privacy costs of cloud-based inference.
Is there anything else you'd like to adjust before you head to the office to set up the workspace?
