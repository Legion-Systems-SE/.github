# Project Onion SE // The Voxel Manifold
> **Sovereign Swedish R&D into 3D Recursive Latent Space.**

## The Vision
Project **Onion SE** is the core technological layer of **Legion Systems SE**. We are moving beyond 1D token prediction into **3D Spatial Manifolds**. By mapping intelligence into a recursive voxel structure, we preserve the multi-dimensional relationships inherent in physical, biological, and acoustic systems.

## Architecture: The 3D Onion
* **Layer 0 (The Core):** Recursive state management and high-density latent storage.
* **Manifold Layer:** A 3D coordinate grid (Voxel) for spatial logic mapping.
* **Overwatch Layer:** Phase-alignment protocols to monitor and govern agent behavior.

## Current Project Status: [Alpha-0.1]
- [x] Infrastructure Initialization (Verified Swedish Node)
- [x] Repository Gain-Staging (.gitignore & Apache 2.0)
- [x] 3D Voxel Manifold Initial Logic (`src/manifold/`)
- [ ] Multiplicity Agent Framework (Phase 2)
